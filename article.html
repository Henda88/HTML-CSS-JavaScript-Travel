        <p class="bb"> Helpful Terminal Commands for Beginners!</p> 


<P>
    This cheat sheet was originally posted on malikbrowne.com.

I love learning new commands and tools to optimize my workflow on my Mac. Since I have started working with more terminal-oriented applications, there are several commands that I use that I'd love to share with beginners and terminal lovers alike.

Note: This article assumes that you're using some type of UNIX shell, with a preference towards Mac. Some of these commands may not work on Windows CMD/Powershell.

<h1>
    Basic Commands
</h1>
<P>
    Commands in a shell can be used in a ton of different ways - but I'd say that the important ones to learn fall under three main categories:
</P>
    <ol>
<li>Navigating and Working with Files & Directories <li>
<li>Manipulating Output for Input</li>
    <li>Finding Things</li>
  </ol>
    
  <h2>Navigating and Working with Files & Directories</h2>

  <p>
    On a computer, files and directories (otherwise known as folders) are responsible for managing information. Here are some commands to make your life easier when working with files:
   
    <ul>
        <li>cd - navigate to different directories</li>
        <li>pwd - see the name of the current directory</li>
        <li>ls - lists all files in the current directory</li>
      </ul>  
      
  </p>
